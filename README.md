This repository contains the full analytical workflow, Python code, figures, and metric tables for a comparative network analysis of two biological systems:

- **Wild Bird Social Network** — RFID-based co-occurrence interactions among *Parus major*.  
- **Scotch Broom Interaction Web** — Multi-trophic ecological network centered on *Cytisus scoparius*.

The project examines structure, motifs, community organization, centrality, null models, and robustness to perturbations through a unified graph-theoretic framework.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Represent each dataset as an undirected graph.
- Compute and compare:
  - Spectral partitions and eigenstructure  
  - Clustering, triangles, and four-cycles  
  - Erdős–Rényi (ER) and configuration-model (CM) null expectations  
  - Louvain community modularity  
  - Degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality  
  - Robustness curves (random, degree-based, betweenness-based removal)
- Identify structural similarities across ecological and behavioral systems.
