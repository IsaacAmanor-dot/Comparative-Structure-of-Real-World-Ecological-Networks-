# Comparative Structure of Real-World Ecological Networks  
### Wild Bird Social Network & Scotch Broom Interaction Web

This repository contains the full analytical workflow, Python code, and figures for a comparative network analysis of two real-world ecological systems:

- **Wild Bird Social Network** — RFID-based co-occurrence data of *Parus major*
- **Scotch Broom Interaction Web** — Multi-trophic ecological network centered on *Cytisus scoparius*

The project investigates structural organization, motifs, community structure, robustness, and statistical properties using modern graph-theoretic tools.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Represent each ecological system as an undirected graph.  
- Compare structural properties using:
  - Spectral analysis  
  - Clustering coefficients  
  - Triangle and 4-cycle motifs  
  - Erdős–Rényi and configuration null models  
  - Louvain community detection  
  - Degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality  
  - Robustness under node removal  
- Evaluate similarities and differences across biological scales.
